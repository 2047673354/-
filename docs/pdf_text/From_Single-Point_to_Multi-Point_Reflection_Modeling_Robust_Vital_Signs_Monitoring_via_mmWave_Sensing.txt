   Note that λ, G, and Pt are typically configured during radar
configuration and remain unchanged while the radar is operating.
The RCS (σ) of a target is determined by factors such as the
target’s material, size, and the angle with the radar. It reflects the
radar wave reflection capability of the target. In the single-point
reflection assumption, factors such as target size and angle are
ignored, keeping the RCS constant for the same target [23]. Thus,
